# Grafana Backend EdgeDB Data Source Plugin

This plugin is based on the documentation and templates provided at https://grafana.com/tutorials/build-a-data-source-backend-plugin and https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend.

It currently only supports basic integration with EdgeDB (no alerts or streaming) and is maintained as a hobby project.
